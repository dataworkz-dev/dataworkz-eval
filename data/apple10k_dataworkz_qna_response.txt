question : What potential risks does the Company face in regards to third-party intellectual property?
answer : 

According to the provided context, the Company faces several potential risks related to third-party intellectual property, including:

1. Inability to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all, which could preclude the Company from selling certain products or services or have a material adverse impact on its business, results of operations, and financial condition.

3. The risk of being notified that it may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties, which could lead to litigation and significant expenses.
4. The risk that third-party developers may cease to develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company's products, which could make customers less likely to buy the Company's products.

question : What risks and costs may increase as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services?
answer : 

According to the context, the risks and costs that may increase as the Company's products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, are related to compliance with laws and regulations. Specifically, these risks and costs include:

* Increased costs of compliance
* Limitations on the Company's ability to offer certain products, services, or features to customers
* Impact on customer demand for the Company's products and services
* Requirements for changes to the Company's supply chain and business
* Uncertainty about the interpretation and application of new and changing laws and regulations.

These risks and costs are likely to increase because the Company's products and services will be subject to more stringent regulations and standards in specialized applications such as health and financial services, where the consequences of non-compliance can be more severe.

question : What is the accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses based on intended use and hedge designation?
answer : 

According to the text, the accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation. Specifically:

* Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
* For options designated as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates.
* Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).
* Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the hedged item.
* For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI&E”) on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge.
* Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.
* Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative instruments relate.

question : What financial strategy did the Company use to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk on its notes?
answer : 

The Company used interest rate swaps and foreign currency swaps to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk on its notes. Specifically, to manage interest rate risk on certain of its U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates on a portion of these notes. Additionally, to manage foreign currency risk on certain of its foreign currency-denominated notes, the Company entered into foreign currency swaps to effectively convert these notes to U.S. dollar-denominated notes.
