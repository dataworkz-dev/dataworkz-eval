# Dataworkz Evaluation Framework

## Setup
1. Configure your OpenAI API key in config/config.json
2. Install package dependencies by running the following command from terminal:
	> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. There are 3 files which are essential to run the evaluation:
	a. Benchmark File: Benchmark tests available publicly.
	b. Response File: Response generated by Dataworkz QnA.
	c. Evaluation File: Final evaluation results would be stored in this file.
	
The Benchmark File and the Response File should contain equal number of rows and each row 
should correspond to the response of the same question.
